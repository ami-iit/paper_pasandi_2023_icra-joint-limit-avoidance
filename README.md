## Abstract
The design of a control architecture for providing the desired motion along with the realization of the joint limitation of a robotic system is still an open challenge in control and robotics.
This paper presents a torque control architecture for fully actuated manipulators for tracking the desired time-varying trajectory while ensuring the joints position and velocity limits.
The presented architecture stems from the parametrization of the feasible joints position and velocity space by exogenous states.
The proposed parametrization transforms the control problem with constrained states to an un-constrained one by replacing the joints position and velocity with the exogenous states.
With the help of Lyapunov-based arguments, we prove that the proposed control architecture ensures the stability and convergence of the desired joint trajectory along with the joints position and velocity limits avoidance.
We validate the performance of proposed architecture through various simulations on a simple two-degree-of-freedom manipulator and the humanoid robot iCub.
